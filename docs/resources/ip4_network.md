# bluecat_ip4_network (Resource)

Resource to create an IPv4 network.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "bluecat_ip4_network" "network" {
  parent_id = data.bluecat_ip4_network-block-range.block.id
  name      = "New Network"
  size      = 256
}

output "bluecat_ip4_network_cidr" {
  value = bluecat_ip4_network.network.cidr
}

- `size` (Number) The size of the IPv4 network expressed as a power of 2. For example, 256 would create a /24. If this argument is changed, then the resource will be recreated.

### Optional

- `allow_duplicate_host` (Boolean) Duplicate host names check.
- `default_domains` (Set of Number) The object ids of the default DNS domains for the network.

- `inherit_dns_restrictions` (Boolean) DNS restrictions are inherited.
- `inherit_ping_before_assign` (Boolean) The network pings an address before assignment is inherited.
- `is_larger_allowed` (Boolean) (Optional) Is it ok to return a network that is larger than the size specified?
- `location_code` (String) The location code of the network.
- `name` (String) The display name of the IPv4 network.
